# Bug Tracking System 

This is a full-stack bug tracking application built for team collaboration, inspired by the issue management system of **GitHub**. The main goal of this project is to provide a platform for teams to efficiently track, manage, and resolve bugs throughout the software development lifecycle.



## üöÄ Key Features

The application is built with a role-based access control system, supporting three distinct user roles: **Admin**, **Tester**, and **Developer**.

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

  * **User Management:** Secure user registration and login with JWT.
  * **Role-Based Access Control:** Permissions for actions like creating a project or assigning a bug are determined by the user's role.
  * **Protected Routes:** A `PrivateRoute` component ensures that only authenticated users can access the main parts of the application.

### üêû Bug Management Workflow

  * **Bug Creation:** Testers can create new bugs, providing details like title, description, and priority.
  * **Full Bug Lifecycle:** The project implements a complete bug lifecycle with dynamic status changes: `Open` -\> `In Progress` -\> `Ready for QA` -\> `Closed`/`Reopened`.
  * **Assignment:** Testers can assign bugs to specific Developers.
  * **Status Updates:** Developers can update the status of bugs assigned to them.
  * **Verification:** Testers have the final say, verifying a bug fix and changing its status to `Closed` or `Reopened`.

### üìÇ Project and Dashboard Views

  * **Project Creation:** Admins and Testers can create and manage new projects.
  * **Project List:** A dedicated page displays all available projects.
  * **Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard shows a summary of the user's role and a list of bugs assigned specifically to them.
